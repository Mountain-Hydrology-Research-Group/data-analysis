## Statistics
 * For reviewing statistics concepts, past students have recommended video lessons from [Khan Academy](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU5aQXLWR3_za0hcdZH2b28MkIXSyHOE2) and [Brandon Foltz](https://www.youtube.com/user/BCFoltz/videos) (which has ads), especially for reviewing distributions, hypothesis testing, and type I and type II error.
 * [Explained Visually](https://setosa.io/ev/): a website that visualizes some concepts from class (markov, conditional probability, eigenvectors, etc.)
 * Where did the Gaussian (normal) distribution come from? see Stahl, 1996 article in [Canvas site](https://canvas.uw.edu/) Readings folder
 * 1-sided vs 2-sided tests for a change in the variance: [NIST Engineering Statistics Handbook, Chi-Square Test for the Variance](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda358.htm) (If you're using a 2-sided test, you need to look up alpha/2 in the chi-squared tables, as shown on the link.)
 
## Programming
 * [PythonNumericalDemos](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/PythonNumericalDemos) demos and visualizations such as this [Interactive Correlation Coefficient Demonstration](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/PythonNumericalDemos/blob/master/Interactive_Correlation_Coefficient.ipynb), by Michael Pyrcz (University of Texas at Austin)
 * [Earth Data Science - EarthLab](https://www.earthdatascience.org/) tutorials: [time series data](https://www.earthdatascience.org/tags/time-series/), [data exploraiton and analysis](https://www.earthdatascience.org/tags/data-exploration-and-analysis/)
 * [Managing conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
 * [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)

```note
The UW eScience institute offers [data science office hours](https://escience.washington.edu/office-hours/) which could be useful for your projects or your own research work.
