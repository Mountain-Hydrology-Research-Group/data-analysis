# 6) Bayesian Statistics


## Lab 6-1: A Bayesian Example

A medical testing company has developed a non-invasive test for Down’s syndrome in the first two months of pregnancy. This test can correctly identify Down’s syndrome by giving a positive result 98% of the time (true positive). Therefore the probability of a false negative is 2%. This test can correctly identify when the fetus does not have Down’s syndrome by giving a negative result 97% of the time (true negative). Therefore the probability of a false positive is 3%. For this example, assume that the observed probability of Down’s syndrome in a random sample from a large number of observations is about 1 in 1,200.

 **A.** Draw a tree diagram for this problem as you work through this example.

 **B.** Using Bayes’ theorem, estimate the probability that a fetus has Down’s syndrome given that the test result is positive. Are you surprised by the answer? What is the fundamental problem with this test?
 
 **C.** How accurate would the test have to be to achieve a 50% probability of having Down’s syndrome given that the test result is positive (true positive)? (**Note**: In this problem, try solving for the accuracies of both the positive and negative test results that will give you a 50% true positive rate. It may not be possible to achieve a 50% true positive rate with one or the other.)

 **D.** Estimate the likelihood that the fetus does not have Down’s Syndrome given that the test result is negative (true negative). Is the test more useful in this framework as a screening step when trying to decide to use more accurate, but also more invasive, tests?
