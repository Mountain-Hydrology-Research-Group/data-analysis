# Lab 6-1: Bayes' Theorem Example: Water Quality Testing

In this scenario, a water quality testing company has developed a new inexpensive technology for detecting "Chemical X" contamination in drinking water. This test can correctly identify the presence or absense of "Chemical X" above a certain threshold by giving a positive result 98% of the time (true positive). Therefore the probability of a false negative is 2%. This test can correctly identify when the water sample does not have "Chemical X" by giving a negative result 97% of the time (true negative). Therefore the probability of a false positive is 3%. For this example, assume that the observed probability of the presense of "Chemical X" in a random sample from a large number of water samples is about 1 in 1,200.

 **A.** Draw a tree diagram for this problem as you work through this example.

 **B.** Using Bayesâ€™ theorem, estimate the probability that a water sample will have "Chemical X" given that the test result is positive. Are you surprised by the answer? What is the fundamental problem with this test?
 
 **C.** How accurate would the test have to be to achieve a 50% probability of having "Chemical X" given that the test result is positive (true positive)? (**Note**: In this problem, try solving for the accuracies of both the positive and negative test results that will give you a 50% true positive rate. It may not be possible to achieve a 50% true positive rate with one or the other.)

 **D.** Estimate the likelihood that a water sample does not have "Chemical X" given that the test result is negative (true negative). Is the test more useful in this framework as a screening step when trying to decide to use more accurate, but also more expensive, tests?
