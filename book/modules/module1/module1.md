# 1) Python, Statistics Review

Each week, the labs are designed to give you specific coding examples to help you with that week's homework.
Please look through the lab material before beginning the homework.  Note that the first week's lab has a lot of examples to help people learning python.  This will get easier as we go.

## Plotting Data and Calculating Statistics in Python

Download the lab and data files to your computer. Then, upload them to your JupyterHub [following the instructions here](/resources/b-learning-jupyter.html#jupyterhub).

* Download this data file for the lab activities: [Skykomish peak flows](data/Skykomish_peak_flow_12134500_skykomish_river_near_gold_bar.xlsx)
* For more practice in plotting, see this [Graphical Data Analysis](lab1/graphical-data-analysis.ipynb) notebook and this [sample data set](data/my_data.csv).
* After we empirically plot how our data are distributed, we often want to compare them to theoretical distributions.  Open the [Probability Distributions](lab1/probability-distributions.ipynb) notebook to examine common theoretical distributions and how to work with them in python.
* [BONUS (not needed to solve homework) Lab 1-3: Generating Random Numbers in Python](lab1/lab1-3.ipynb) ([Solution to Lab 1-3 activity](lab1/lab1-3_solution.ipynb))
