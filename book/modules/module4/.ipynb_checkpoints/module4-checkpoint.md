# 4) Trend Analysis, Regression


Download the following data files to your computer. Then, download each lab activity notebook, and upload them all to your JupyterHub [following the instructions here](/resources/b-learning-jupyter.md). Work through these activities before starting on the homework assignment.

* Annual peak snow water equivalent as measured at two snow-pillow sites {Download}`pillows_example.csv</modules/data/pillows_example.csv>`
* [What is a snow pillow? Check out the website for CEWA 568: Snow Hydrology](https://mountain-hydrology-research-group.github.io/snow-hydrology/modules/module2.html)
* We often hear that preditability between one snow site and another is decreasing in recent years due to climatic change.  The original lab only looked at data through 2010, but now you can repeat it with data through 2024 to see what changes in the regression. This will become more important in Lab 5 {Download}`pillows_example_2024.csv</modules/data/pillows_example_2024.csv>`

Also, take a look at this notebook exploring [confidence intervals](/modules/module2/confidence-intervals.ipynb) with our {Download}`snow depth guesses</modules/data/snow_depth_guesses.csv>` from the lecture.
