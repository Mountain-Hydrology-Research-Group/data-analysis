### Guiding principles for this quarter
1. **Nobody signed up for this.**
  * Not for the sickness, not for the social distancing, not for the sudden end of our collective lives together on campus
  * Not for an online class, not for teaching remotely, not for learning from home, not for mastering new learning technologies, not for varied access to learning materials
2. **The humane option is the best option.**
  * We are going to prioritize supporting each other as humans
  * We are going to prioritize simple solutions that make sense
  * We are going to prioritize sharing resources and communicating clearly
  * We are going to prioritize learning what is most useful for you
3. **We cannot just do the same thing online.**
  * Some assignments are no longer possible
  * Some expectations are no longer reasonable
4. **We will foster intellectual nourishment, social connection, and personal accommodation.**
  * Accessible asynchronous content for diverse access, time zones, and contexts
  * Optional synchronous discussion to learn together and combat isolation
5. **We will remain flexible and adjust to the situation.**
  * Nobody knows where this is going and what we’ll need to adapt
  * Everybody needs support and understanding in this unprecedented moment
  * Provide feedback at any point in the quarter and we will try to improve and adapt
6. **We’re all in this together**

(These principles were adapted from the [Adjusted Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-6d_W8rdzE9mW2DvPi-dPvRxo4sekKlz3VqEpnu4Dwg/preview) by Brandon Bayne at UNC Chapel Hill)

 * **Additional Course Materials** are available on the [UW Canvas site](https://canvas.uw.edu/) (UW NetID login required)


### Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students should be able to
 * Understand common terminology in statistics and data analysis and know how to search for more detailed information as needed
 * Read, modify, and write computer programs to analyze data
 * Apply statistics and computer-based data analysis techniques to real observations (sets of numbers) in order to solve real world problems

## Logistics and Grading

### Computing Resources

For lab activities and assignments, we will be using a [JupyterHub](https://spestana.github.io/data-analysis-rtd/resources/b-learning-jupyter.html) computing environment, and programming with [python](https://spestana.github.io/data-analysis-rtd/resources/a-learning-python.html). (While the course is taught using python, prior versions of the labs in MATLAB are also available by request.)

If you need access to a laptop computer (such as if yours breaks) you may check one out from the [Student Technology Loan Program](https://stlp.uw.edu/). Please contact me if you need help accessing a computer reliably.


### Lectures

The first half of each class period is reserved for lectures and discussions. We will be using Zoom for these live lectures, and to record lectures for later viewing. Lectures will be recorded and made available afterwards. Lecture slides will be available on Canvas, along with any additional files for reading.


### Labs

Following a ~10 minute break after each lecture, we will reconvene in Zoom for the lab portion of the class (this will not be recorded). Lab content (jupyter notebooks and data files) can be downloaded directly from the from class website. ([GitHub Option](https://spestana.github.io/data-analysis-rtd/resources/b-learning-jupyter.html#working-with-files-on-our-jupyterhub))

We will use Zoom breakout rooms, and Slack to work in small groups on Lab excercises. As we learn what works and what doesn't in our online learning environment, we'll adapt and modify lab logistics. Contact the instructor or TA to be added to the Slack workspace.


### Homework Assignments

Homework assignments will be given out on Thursday at the beginning of class, and will be **due the following week on Thursday at the beginning of class (10:30 am, Pacific Time)**. Homework questions are posted on the class website along with links to any data files you might need.

You are encouraged to work together on homeworks and collaborate, but you must turn in your own assignments with your own work. If you are working with a group, please specify who you worked with on the homework document you turn in.

Make sure that your name and the assignment number are at the top of your notebook file in markdown text. Your answers should be clearly labeled and written in markdown cells of the notebook.

Submit your completed homework assignments via Canvas by uploading:
* Your original .ipynb jupyter notebook file(s)
  * To download your notebook file, right click on the file in the navigation pane on JupyterHub, then click *Download*
* A PDF copy of the jupyter notebook file(s)
  * To save your notebook as a PDF, go to *File* > *Export Notebook As...* > *Export Notebook to PDF*, this will download a PDF file copy of your notebook to your personal computer which you can upload to Canvas

Homework will be graded on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Homework handed in late will be accepted up to (but not later than) Monday at 5:00 pm (Pacific Time), but two grade points will be deducted from the grade for late assignments (i.e. a late assignment that would receive a 10 if handed in on time will be assigned a grade of 8). Late homework assignments will not be accepted after 5:00 pm (Pacific Time) on the Monday following the due date.

Homework solutions will be posted in the Solutions folder on [Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/) by the Tuesday after the assignment was turned in.


### Final Exam (for CEE 465)

The final exam will be take-home, and will be assigned on Monday, December 7th, giving you a full week to complete it. The exam will ask a series of general application questions spanning all of the topics covered in the course. It will be open notes and online materials, but students must sign an honor statement that the work is their own and not done with consultation and/or help from other students, friends, or faculty. The final exam must be submitted electronically, via Canvas, before 5:00 pm (Pacific Time) of the day on the [scheduled final exam date](https://www.washington.edu/students/reg/A2020exam.html): **Monday, December 14, 5:00 pm (Pacific Time)**.

### Final Project (for CEWA 565)

Final projects will be completed in pairs (or individually on request), and the topic will be selected by the students in consultation with the instructor. The topic should ideally involve data analysis related to a real-world engineering problem from within the student’s area of interest. Updates on the project are required as part of the 2nd, 5th, and 7th homework assignments, and each student will give a short overview of their research problem and project results to the class on **12/3**, **12/8** and **12/10**. The project will be graded on the basis of the presentation (20%) and on the report (80%), which should be less than 10 pages long. Final reports will be due on **Monday, December 14, 5:00 pm (Pacific Time)**. Further details are provided on the [Course Project page](b-project.html).

### Grading Policy

* **Class Attendance and Participation: 5%**
  * Participation includes discussions in class, on Slack, and providing feedback on student presentations
  * *If you plan on attending class asynchronously by watching the recorded lectures, please let me know.*
* **Homework assignments: 70%**
  * Each of the 8 homework assignments are worth 10 points (for a total of 80 points), however your overall homework grade will be evaluated out of 70 points total.
* **Final Project / Final Exam: 25%**
  * See the [CEWA 565 course project page](/overview/b-project.html) for grading rubric.

### Conduct

The University takes academic integrity very seriously. Behaving with integrity is part of our responsibility to our shared learning community. One example of misconduct I have observed in this particular class in the past is plagiarism (representing the work of others as your own without giving appropriate credit to the original author(s)). **If you’re uncertain about if something is academic misconduct, ask me. I am willing to discuss questions you might have.**

The University of Washington Student Conduct Code (WAC 478-121) defines prohibited academic and behavioral conduct and describes how the University holds students accountable as they pursue their academic goals. Allegations of misconduct by students may be referred to the appropriate campus office for investigation and resolution. More information can be found online at [https://www.washington.edu/studentconduct/](https://www.washington.edu/studentconduct/)


### Access and Accommodations

If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course. If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924 or [uwdrs@uw.edu](mailto:uwdrs@uw.edu) or [disability.uw.edu](https://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/). DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions.  Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between you, your instructor(s) and DRS.  It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law.


### Religious Accommodations

Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW’s policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at [Religious Accommodations Policy (https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/)](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/). Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the [Religious Accommodations Request form (https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/)](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/).
